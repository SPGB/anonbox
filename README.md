###ANON BOX

Anon box will scan an imageboard for threads, compile it into a list of threads, and scan those threads for new images and download them into a file for you. All in the background. You can set it to only scan threads with a certain keyword, and how you want those images sorted. You can also set it to a wallpaper mode where it's a live picture frame of the most recent images.
